# Linux-adminstration-final-project
This project consists of 3 parts:
1) Bash Scripting - Writing a bash script that creates a new user and group and assign the user to this group. Another script creates a directory, archives it and copies it to the newly created user.
2) Makefiles & CMake - Generating static and dynamic libraries then linking and generating the final output using both make and CMake.
3) Networking & Process management - Establishing an ssh connection between linux and the native windows and then, executing a multi-process task manager application from inside Windows Powershell.
